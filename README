ceil2ff

A python package for converting any *known* ceilometer raw data formats into SI
(m^-1 sr^-1) backscatter coefficient variables in a gridded flat file, 
with Unix timestamps. These files should be much easier to read by subsequent
processors. No averaging is to be computed.

At version 1.0, this is not built for speed, but for power, and accuracy. Ideally
this code need only be run once on a dataset. It also does not have many decision
making abilities, and generally runs over an entire folder's contents.

This is an expansion off the basic code derived from initial development of the 
UUAdip data manager by Joe Young at the University of Utah. Eventually, UUAdip 
will utilize this package in its processing.
